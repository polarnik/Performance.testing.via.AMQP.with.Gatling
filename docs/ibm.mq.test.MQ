admin/passw0rd

The following users are created:

User admin for administration (in the mqm group). Default password is passw0rd.
User app for messaging (in a group called mqclient). No password by default.
Users in mqclient group have been given access connect to all queues and topics starting with DEV.** and have put, get, pub, sub, browse and inq permissions.

The following queues and topics are created:

DEV.QUEUE.1
DEV.QUEUE.2
DEV.QUEUE.3
DEV.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE - configured as the Queue Manager's Dead Letter Queue.
DEV.BASE.TOPIC - uses a topic string of dev/.
Two channels are created, one for administration, the other for normal messaging:

DEV.ADMIN.SVRCONN - configured to only allow the admin user to connect into it. A user and password must be supplied.
DEV.APP.SVRCONN - does not allow administrative users to connect. Password is optional unless you choose a password for app users.
A new listener is created (the SYSTEM listener is fine, but system objects are not shown by default in the web console):

DEV.LISTENER.TCP - listens on port 1414.
